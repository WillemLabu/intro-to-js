# Intro to JS

This repository is the basis of the *Web Development Level 1: JavaScript* short-course at [The Open Window](http://openwindow.co.za) for 2015.

The class is a 101 for JavaScript, jQuery and NodeJS; it will also cover a few other development workflows like Git and rapid prototyping.

## Repository Layout

The repository will be sectioned into the 5 weeks of the course, each with it's own `slides`, `examples`, and `homework` folders.

## Requirements

The `slides` folders each contain a [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.

The tasks require [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and a local server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com/), or [WAMPP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for rapid development.
